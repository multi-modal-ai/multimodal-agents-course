# TODO

- Add video index as we have a long video split into chunks
- When querying, find out which video index it is and multiply video_pos_msec with that.
- Eg, if we have a 5min video
  - split 5x1 min
  - insert (v1, 1), (v2, 2) ...
  - FrameView will contain all the frames sampled at 1fps, but each pos will start 00 - 60 (since each video is 1min long)
  - When quering, we get the topk1 good based on transcripts, but the frames are 00-60, and it'll always get the first video whatsoever

- We need to:
- on querying, check which video index the transcript matched best
- get the index
- multiply frames_pos with that, so it'll jump to the correct "blob" of frames

Example, if video = 3, and start = 00, end = 50 (20 frames at 1fps), we need to sample frames at 3 * 00 as start, and 3 * 50 as end, which will move the
buffer of frames pointer to (3*60) -- (30*60 + 50) and sample frames 180 - 230.
